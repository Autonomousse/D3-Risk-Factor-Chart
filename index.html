                    <h2>Correlations Discovered</h2>
                    <p class="text text-style">From the chart, many correlations can be seen. However, there are a few prominent ones to discuss.</p>

                    <p class="text text-style">Poverty seems to be ridden with issues across the board. From the chart, we can see that as poverty increases, 
                      so does the lack of healthcare, the number of people who smoke, and the number of people who are obese. This makes sense as healthcare
                      and healthy food options tend to be rather expensive in the country. If we look at median household income, we see the opposite trend.
                      Simply put, we can correlate that there is a price to pay if one wants to be healthy. It's rather ironic that sugary carbonated beverages
                      cost less than a bottle of water at some places in the country. Maybe the issue isn't just income or poverty, perhaps there needs to be
                      a push towards being healthy as a country rather than it being an individual choice or goal.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text text-style">Smoking is interesting because as the median household income increases,
                      the number of people who smoke decrease. Which could be due to people with higher incomes spending on more expensive drugs or even alcohol. 
                      A comparison with alcohol and narcotics consumption may reveal similar trends in poverty and income.</p>
